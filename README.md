# Autogen Task Management System

This project is a system that automates the process of generating and describing code to solve user-submitted tasks. It uses three main agents:

- **User Proxy Agent**: The overseer who approves and monitors the task.
- **Developer Agent**: The coder who generates and executes the required code.
- **Planner Agent**: The describer who explains the code generated by the Developer Agent.

The agents work together to ensure that tasks are executed properly and explained in detail.

## Features

- Submit tasks for code generation.
- The system handles code execution and validation.
- After execution, the code is described in detail by the Planner Agent.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install required dependencies -- autogen using `pip` or another package manager.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the task you want the system to handle.
3. The agents will automatically generate, execute, and explain the code.
