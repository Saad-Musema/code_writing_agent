## Overview

This project uses three main agents to manage tasks:

- **User Proxy Agent**: Oversees the task, approves plans, and monitors execution.
- **Developer Agent**: Generates and executes the required code.
- **Planner Agent**: Describes the code generated by the Developer Agent in detail.

The agents work together to ensure that tasks are executed properly and explained in detail.

## Features

- Submit tasks for code generation.
- Automated code execution and validation.
- Detailed explanation of the generated code by the Planner Agent.
- Supports handling edge cases and proper error management.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv agent
    source agent/bin/activate  # On Windows use `agent\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python code_writer.py
    ```

2. Enter the task you want the system to handle when prompted.

3. The agents will automatically generate, execute, and explain the code.
